# SMART PLOT ASSISTANT

A modern, single-page web application designed to help users manage and analyze real estate plot information. This project is a front-end-only demonstration built with pure **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, showcasing a dynamic and animated user interface without any frameworks.

This one-stop dashboard provides four key utilities for anyone managing or researching land plots: a layout map viewer, an area converter, a loan calculator, and a personal notes manager.

## ✨ Features

The application is a Single-Page Application (SPA), meaning navigation is instant and doesn't require page reloads.

  * 🗺️ **Layout Map Viewer**

      * Displays a project layout map (requires a `Layout_photo.png` file).
      * Includes a fallback mode: if the image isn't found, it gracefully displays an interactive table with all plot details.
      * Contains hardcoded data for over 100 plots (Plot No, Survey No, Area, and Price).
      * Toggleable info panel to view the plot data table at any time.

  * 📐 **Area Converter**

      * A handy utility to convert between common land area units.
      * Supports: **Square Feet**, **Square Meter**, **Acre**, and **Hectare**.

  * 💰 **Loan EMI Calculator**

      * Calculates loan details based on user input.
      * Inputs: Loan Amount (₹), Annual Interest Rate (%), and Loan Tenure (Years).
      * Outputs: **Monthly EMI**, **Total Interest Payable**, and **Total Payable Amount**.

  * 📝 **My Notes (Full CRUD)**

      * A complete note-taking system to manage plot-related information.
      * **Create:** Add new notes with a title, plot info, category, and detailed content.
      * **Read:** View all notes in a clean, card-based list or a full-page view.
      * **Update:** Edit any existing note.
      * **Delete:** Remove notes with a confirmation.
      * Categories include: Legal, Financial, Technical, Personal, Maintenance, and Other.

## 🎨 Key Design & UI Elements

The primary focus of this project is its modern and dynamic user interface.

  * **🌌 Animated Background:** A multi-layered, animated background featuring:
      * Floating, blurred gradient shapes.
      * A subtle, animated grid pattern to evoke a blueprint.
      * Fading in/out building emojis (🏢, 🏠, 🏗️) to fit the real estate theme.
  * **💎 Glassmorphism UI:** A "frosted glass" effect is used on all cards and forms (`backdrop-filter: blur(...)`) for a sleek, modern feel.
  * **🖌️ Rich Hover Effects:**
      * Cards lift, scale, and cast a larger shadow on hover.
      * A "sheen" or "shine" effect sweeps across cards.
      * Icons animate (scale and rotate) on card hover.
  * **🚀 Smooth Animations:** All sections and forms fade and slide in smoothly using CSS keyframes for a fluid user experience.
  * **📱 Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and adapts cleanly to mobile and tablet screens.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

  * **HTML5:** Semantic HTML for a clean structure.
  * **CSS3:** Advanced styling with Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties, Animations, and Pseudo-elements.
  * **JavaScript (ES6+):** 100% **Vanilla JS** for all logic, including:
      * Single-Page Application (SPA) routing
      * DOM manipulation
      * Event handling
      * All calculations and state management

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can run this project locally in just a few steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-plot-assistant.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**

    ```bash
    cd smart-plot-assistant
    ```

3.  **Open the file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

### **Important: Layout Map**

To see the **Layout Map** feature work as intended, you must add an image file named `Layout_photo.png` to the same root directory as `index.html`.

If you don't have this file, the application will automatically fall back to the data table view, so the "Layout Map" card will still be fully functional.

-----

## ⚠️ Limitations

  * **No Database:** This is a front-end-only project. All data (the plot list and any notes you create) is stored in JavaScript variables.
  * **No Persistence:** Because there is no database, any notes you add or edit will be **lost** as soon as you refresh the page.
